    "# 📖 Overview\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This notebook presents a **structured and reproducible workflow** for **preprocessing and exploring Zillow property data**.  \r\n",
    "The project emphasizes effective **data cleaning** and **feature engineering** techniques, preparing the dataset for deeper **real estate insights** and future **modeling** tasks.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The primary objective is to **streamline the processing of raw Zillow data**, transforming it into a **structured and insightful format**.  \r\n",
    "This work lays a strong foundation for potential extensions such as **predictive modeling**, **dashboard development**, and broader **real estate market analysis**.  \r\n",
    "While designed to simulate a scalable data pipeline, this project focuses on processing a static dataset and showcasing **best practices** that can be adapted for automated ingestion workflows.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "## 💡 What does this notebook do?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- Imports raw Zillow property data from a compressed **`.zip`** file.\r\n",
    "- Cleans the data by handling **missing values**, **inconsistent formatting**, and **irrelevant columns**.\r\n",
    "- Transforms **categorical**, **numerical**, and **date** features for easier analysis.\r\n",
    "- Builds a solid foundation for further **exploratory analysis**, **visualizations**, and **machine learning** modeling.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 🧹 Key Steps in Preprocessing:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- Decompressed and loaded data efficiently from a **zipped format**.\r\n",
    "- Standardized key features (e.g., **price**, **date**, **property characteristics**).\r\n",
    "- Handled missing data with logical strategies like **imputation** or **removal**.\r\n",
    "- Structured complex features (e.g., **tax information**, **mortgages**, **nearby houses**, **nearby schools**) into usable formats.\r\n",
    "- Created **new engineered features** to enhance future analysis.\r\n",

    "1. **Optimize Data Types**:  \r\n",

    "   - **Convert object columns with low cardinality to category**: Columns with a small number of unique values (low cardinality) are converted to the `category` data type to improve performance, especially when the number of unique values is much smaller than the total number of records.\r\n",
    "   - **Convert date columns to datetime**: We ensure that all date columns (`datePosted`, `timeOnZillow`, `dateSold`, `lastUpdated`, `lastUpdatedDate`) are correctly converted to the `datetime` format for easier manipulation and analysis.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Drop Columns with High Null Percentage**:  \r\n",
    "   - Columns with more than 50% missing values are dropped from the DataFrame to avoid potential biases or inefficiencies when training machine learning models.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Merge DataFrames on 'zpid'**:  \r\n",
    "   - We use the `merge()` function to combine the **master DataFrame** (`merged_data`) with the cleaned **tax and mortgage data** (`merged_df`) on the `'zpid'` column. This creates a unified dataset for further analysis.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Drop Irrelevant or Redundant Columns**:  \r\n",
    "   - We drop certain columns that are not relevant for the analysis or are redundant, such as `'streetAddress'`, `'url'`, `'lastUpdatedTimestamp_x'`, and `'taxPaid'`. This step helps to keep the dataset clean and focused on essential features.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Final Check**:  \r\n",
    "   - We print the shape and summary info of the final DataFrame to ensure that the merge was successful and that the dataset is ready for the next phase of analysis or modeling.\r\n",
    "\r\n",

    "## 🔹 Historical Price Data Processing and Integration\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this section, we focused on processing the historical price data (`pr_his`) to extract key features that will help us understand pricing trends and behavior over time. The goal was to calculate several historical price metrics, which include the most recent price, average price, median price, and price change rate for each property (`zpid`). These metrics will play a key role in our modeling process.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 1. **Data Preprocessing**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The first step involved cleaning and converting key columns in the historical price data to ensure they were in a suitable format for further analysis.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Datetime Conversion**:  \r\n",
    "  The `dateOfEvent` and `lastUpdated` columns were converted to `datetime` format to allow proper manipulation of date-related data. This enables us to track price changes over time and perform time-based analysis.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Boolean Conversion for Rentals**:  \r\n",
    "  The `postingIsRental` column, which indicates whether a property is listed as a rental, was converted to a Boolean type (`True`/`False`). This transformation makes it easier to analyze rental vs non-rental properties in subsequent analyses.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2. **Sorting and Grouping for Historical Price Analysis**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The data was sorted by `zpid` (property ID) and `dateOfEvent` to ensure that the most recent price events appear first for each property. This sorting is critical for calculating the price metrics based on the most recent data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Next, we calculated several key historical price metrics:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Most Recent Price**: The first price entry for each property (`zpid`) was taken as the most recent price event.\r\n",
    "- **Average Price**: The average price across all historical entries for each property was calculated to capture general price trends.\r\n",
    "- **Median Price**: The median price for each property was computed to reduce the influence of outliers.\r\n",
    "- **Price Change Rate**: The difference between the most recent price and the earliest price was calculated to determine how much the price had changed over time.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 3. **Extracting Key Metrics**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Once the necessary price metrics were calculated, we focused on the most recent record for each property to ensure we were working with the latest data. The calculated historical price metrics were then mapped to the most recent records to enrich the dataset with relevant pricing features.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The most recent price records were retained, and redundant columns such as `price`, `priceChangeRate`, and `lastUpdated` were removed to clean up the dataset and make it more manageable.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 4. **Merging with the Master Dataset**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "After processing the historical price data, we merged it with our main **master DataFrame** (`data`) to integrate the calculated historical price metrics into the broader dataset. This merge was done using the `zpid` (property ID) to ensure that each property had its corresponding price metrics from the historical dataset.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The merged dataset was then reorganized so that the `zpid` column would appear first, improving the structure and readability of the DataFrame. We ensured that all properties from the master dataset were included, even if there was no corresponding historical price data, by using a left join during the merge.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 5. **Final Dataset Overview**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "After merging the historical price data, the final dataset contains additional features, such as:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Most Recent Price**: The most up-to-date price for each property.\r\n",
    "- **Average Price**: The average price over the property's entire history.\r\n",
    "- **Median Price**: The median price, which provides a more robust measure against extreme price values.\r\n",
    "- **Price Change Rate**: The change in price from the earliest to the most recent listing.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "These new features are now part of the master dataset and will be used in the next stages of analysis and modeling to better understand property pricing trends.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Outcome\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "By processing and integrating the historical price data, we have successfully enhanced the master dataset with key pricing features that will aid in predictive modeling and analysis. The enriched dataset provides a more comprehensive view of each property’s price history, which will be crucial in building models that can predict future property prices or identify trends.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This process not only improves our dataset but also sets the stage for more advanced analyses and predictive modeling in the next phases of the project.\r\n",

    "### 2. **Flattening and Renaming Columns**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "After aggregating the data, the columns are multi-level. To make them more accessible, we flatten the multi-level column names and rename them for clarity. This will help in later steps when analyzing and merging the data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 3. **Mapping School Types and Grade Levels**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To simplify the data, we map the school types and grade levels into broader categories:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **School Types**:  \r\n",
    "  We map various school types (such as 'Public', 'Charter', and their combinations) into more consistent categories like `Public`, `Charter`, and `Charter & Public`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Grade Levels**:  \r\n",
    "  We categorize grade levels (e.g., 'High', 'Middle', 'Primary', 'Elementary') into broader groups such as `High`, `Middle`, `Primary`, and `Other`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 4. **Calculating School Rating and Distance Ranges**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Next, we create two new columns to represent the range of school ratings and distances:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **School Rating Range**:  \r\n",
    "  This is calculated by subtracting the minimum school rating from the maximum school rating.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **School Distance Range**:  \r\n",
    "  The range of school distances is computed by subtracting the nearest school distance from the farthest school distance.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 5. **Final Adjustments and Cleanup**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this step, we perform additional cleanup to remove unnecessary columns and rename others for consistency. For example, we drop the 'school_names' column and rename 'grade_levels' to 'school_grade_levels'.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 6. **Merging with the Master Dataset**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Once the school data is processed and transformed, we merge it with the main dataset (`merged_data`). The `zpid` column is used as a common identifier between both datasets. We perform a `left` join to ensure that all properties from the main dataset are retained, even if there is no corresponding school data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We also reorder the columns to place `zpid` at the beginning for consistency.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 7. **Final Dataset Review**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "After the merge, the `final_merged` dataset now includes enhanced features related to nearby schools, including:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Average, Maximum, and Minimum School Ratings**\r\n",
    "- **Average, Nearest, and Farthest School Distances**\r\n",
    "- **School Types**\r\n",
    "- **School Rating and Distance Ranges**\r\n",
    "- **Grade Levels**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "These features will provide valuable insights for further analysis or modeling, and they offer a better understanding of the properties' proximity to schools.\r\n"

    "\r\n",
    "In this section, we handle missing values across various columns in the dataset using different imputation techniques. Each imputation method was selected based on the nature of the column and the type of data it holds.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 1. **Impute Missing Values in 'county'**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The missing values in the `county` column are imputed with the default value `'Orange County'`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2. **Impute Missing Categorical Values Using Mode per 'event'**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For categorical columns such as `source`, `postingIsRental`, and `dateOfEvent`, we impute missing values based on the mode (most frequent value) for each specific `event`. If the mode is not available, a fallback value is used:\r\n",
    "- `'N/A'` for non-date columns\r\n",
    "- `'1970-01-01'` for `dateOfEvent`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 3. **Impute 'duration_in_hours' Using Mean per 'event'**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Missing values in the `duration_in_hours` column are imputed with the mean of the `duration_in_hours` for each respective `event`. If no valid mean is found, the missing value is filled with `0`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 4. **Impute 'days_since' Using Median per 'event'**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The `days_since` column is imputed with the median value of `days_since` for each specific `event`. If the median value is unavailable, the missing value is filled with `0`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 5. **Impute Numerical Columns Grouped by ['zipcode', 'homeType'] with Fallback to Global Median**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For numerical columns like `valueIncreaseRate`, `taxIncreaseRate`, and `propertyValue`, missing values are imputed first by the median value within each group defined by `zipcode` and `homeType`. If no group median is available, the global median is used.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 6. **Impute 'yearBuilt' with Smart Logic**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The `yearBuilt` column is treated with special logic:\r\n",
    "- First, we replace any absurd values such as `0` or `9999` with `NaN`.\r\n",
    "- Then, missing values are imputed with the median value within each group defined by `homeType` and `zipcode`. If no group median is available, the global median is used for imputation.\r\n",
